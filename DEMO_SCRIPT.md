# Audio2Text Dev Demo Script ðŸŽ¤

## What This Is
A casual walkthrough for showing off our Audio2Text app to other devs. Think "hey, check out this cool thing I built" rather than a formal presentation. 

## Quick Setup (5 mins)

### Make Sure Everything Works
- [ ] Kill any running node processes (`taskkill /f /im node.exe` on Windows)
- [ ] Run `npm run build` - should complete without errors
- [ ] Run `npm run lint` - fix any issues
- [ ] Test Azure APIs are responding (check `/api/env-check`)
- [ ] Have 1-2 sample MP3s ready (2-3 min each)

### Sample Audio Ideas
- **Meeting**: "So we need to decide on the database migration timeline..."
- **Interview**: "Tell me about your experience with React hooks..."
- **Podcast**: "Welcome to today's episode about TypeScript best practices..."

### Backup Plans
- Screenshots of key features
- Pre-transcribed text ready to paste
- Azure Portal open for "look, it's really using the APIs"

## The Demo Flow (15-20 mins)

### Start Simple (2 mins)
**Just say:** "So I built this thing that takes audio files and lets you chat with them. Pretty neat, right?"

**Show the interface:**
- Clean shadcn/ui components
- Drag & drop file upload
- TypeScript everywhere (point to browser dev tools)
- "Built with Next.js 15, so it's actually fast"

### Upload & Transcribe (3 mins)
**The fun part:**
1. **Upload a file**
   - "Just drag and drop any MP3"
   - Show file validation (size, type checking)
   - "Client-side validation because why waste API calls?"

2. **Hit transcribe**
   - "This calls Azure Whisper API"
   - Show loading state
   - "Real-time processing, not pre-recorded"
   - Wait for it... "Look at that accuracy!"

**While it's processing, mention:**
- "Azure Whisper is actually pretty good"
- "Supports 50+ languages (we're using English for now)"
- "25MB limit because that's Azure's thing"

### Chat With Your Audio (8 mins)
**Now the magic happens:**

**Start with basics:**
1. **"Summarize this"** - Show it extracts key points
2. **"What was mentioned about [specific topic]?"** - Demonstrate precise retrieval
3. **"What are the main themes?"** - Show analytical thinking

**Get more complex:**
4. **"What are the pros and cons discussed?"** - Analytical breakdown
5. **"How does X compare to Y?"** - Comparative analysis
6. **"What conclusions can be drawn?"** - Inference capabilities

**Show conversation flow:**
7. **"Can you explain that in more detail?"** - Context awareness
8. **"What do you mean by [term]?"** - Interactive clarification
9. **"List that as bullet points"** - Format flexibility

**Pro tip:** Ask follow-up questions to show it remembers context

### Show Off the Tech Stack (3 mins)
**Developer stuff they'll care about:**

**Architecture:**
- Next.js 15 App Router (server/client components)
- TypeScript everywhere (no `any` types!)
- shadcn/ui components (copy-paste heaven)
- Tailwind CSS (utility-first styling)

**API Routes:**
- `/api/transcribe` - handles file upload + Whisper
- `/api/chat` - manages conversation with GPT
- "API keys never leave the server"

**Security:**
- Server-side only processing
- Input validation everywhere
- File type/size restrictions
- "Actually production-ready"

**Performance:**
- Client-side validation
- Proper loading states
- Responsive design
- "Built to scale"

### Break Stuff (Optional - 2 mins)
**Show error handling:**
- Upload non-audio file â†’ "See? Client-side validation"
- Upload huge file â†’ "25MB limit enforced"
- Ask something random â†’ "It's honest about limitations"

**Why show errors?**
- Shows robust error handling
- Demonstrates input validation
- "Real apps need this stuff"

## Dev Questions They'll Ask

**Q: "How accurate is the transcription?"**
A: "Pretty good! 90-95% for clear audio. Whisper handles accents and background noise surprisingly well."

**Q: "What about the cost?"**
A: "About $0.60 per hour of audio. Compare that to $60-180 for traditional transcription - it's basically free."

**Q: "Can it handle multiple speakers?"**
A: "Whisper can detect speaker changes, but we're not labeling them yet. That's Phase 2."

**Q: "What languages?"**
A: "English for now, but Whisper supports 50+ languages. Easy to add."

**Q: "How long did this take to build?"**
A: "About 2-3 days. Next.js + shadcn/ui + Azure APIs = fast development."

**Q: "Can I see the code?"**
A: "Sure! It's all TypeScript, well-structured, and production-ready."

**Q: "What's next?"**
A: "Multi-language support, conversation history, export features, maybe real-time transcription..."

## If Things Go Wrong

**Demo fails? No worries:**
1. **Screenshots** - "Here's what it looks like when it works"
2. **Pre-transcribed text** - Paste it in and show the chat
3. **Azure Portal** - "Look, it's really calling the APIs"
4. **Code walkthrough** - "Here's how it's built"

**Common issues:**
- Azure API timeout â†’ "Sometimes Azure is slow"
- File too big â†’ "That's why we have validation"
- Network issues â†’ "Real-world problems, right?"
- Browser cache â†’ "Classic dev problem"
