## Q&A Preparation

### Common Questions and Answers:

**Q: How accurate is the transcription?**
A: Azure Whisper provides high accuracy, especially for clear speech. Accuracy depends on audio quality, speaker clarity, and background noise.

**Q: What file formats are supported?**
A: We support MP3, WAV, and M4A formats up to 25MB, which covers most common audio recording scenarios.

**Q: How secure is the application?**
A: Very secure. API keys never leave the server, all processing happens server-side, and we implement comprehensive input validation.

**Q: Can it handle multiple languages?**
A: Yes, Azure Whisper supports multiple languages. The current implementation defaults to English but can be configured for other languages.

**Q: What about privacy and data retention?**
A: Audio files are processed and not stored. Only the transcript is temporarily available for the chat session. No persistent storage of user data.

**Q: How does it scale?**
A: Built on Next.js with serverless functions, it can scale automatically based on demand. Azure OpenAI handles the heavy lifting for AI processing.

**Q: What's the cost structure?**
A: Costs are based on Azure OpenAI usage - approximately $0.006 per minute for transcription and token-based pricing for chat interactions.
